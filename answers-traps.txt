Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

函数的参数存在a0-a7，例子中13存在a2中。
 
Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

不存在，g被内联到了f函数，f又被内联到了main函数中。

At what address is the function printf located?

630
 
What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

0x38, jalr指令执行后将pc+4后存入ra，之后跳转。

Run the following code.
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

输出是 HE110 World  如果RISC-V改为大端序，需要改为unsigned int i = 0x00726c64;
57616不需要改变。

In the following code, what is going to be printed after ? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen? 'y=' printf("x=%d y=%d", 3)
y=后的%d没有参数，所以会读取某一寄存器中现有的值。
 
输出为x=3 y=8229
